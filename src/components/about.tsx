                Hello! I'm Bernard Santosa, a third-year Computer Science student at Bina Nusantara University, focusing on the Intelligent Systems (AI) stream.
                <br /><br />
                I have a strong interest in exploring Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning concepts such as neural networks and data analysis.  
                Besides AI, Iâ€™m also passionate about software engineering, especially backend development. My main goal is to build solutions that address real-world problems.  
                I am committed to writing clean, efficient code and enjoy working collaboratively to bring ideas to life.
